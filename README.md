# Real-time Chat Application using Gemini API, Dart Frog Server, and WebSockets

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **real-time chat application** built with **Flutter** that integrates the **Gemini API** for natural language processing and uses a **Dart Frog Server** to manage WebSocket connections.  
It allows seamless **bi-directional communication** between client and server, enabling users to chat and receive **AI-powered responses in real time**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔹 **Gemini API Integration** – Generates natural, human-like responses to user queries.  
- 🔹 **Dart Frog Server** – Manages WebSocket connections and broadcasts updates to connected clients.  
- 🔹 **WebSockets** – Enables real-time communication between client and server with low latency.  
- 🔹 **Chat Repository** – Handles message updates and subscriptions for efficient state management.  
- 🔹 **Authorization** – Secured WebSocket communication using **Bearer Tokens**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)  
- **Backend:** Dart Frog Server  
- **API:** Gemini API (Natural Language Processing)  
- **Communication:** WebSockets  

## ⚡ How It Works
1. User sends a message from the Flutter app.  
2. The message is sent via WebSocket to the Dart Frog server.  
3. The server communicates with the **Gemini API** to process the request.  
4. Gemini API responds with AI-generated text.  
5. The response is sent back to the client via WebSocket and displayed in the chat UI.
